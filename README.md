#### <font color="ushua">Sentiment Analysis
---
## This repo is about sentiment analysis on twiter dataset using Word2Vec representation and Logistic regression as a model
#### It's a binary classification , Either the tweet is positive or negative

* I used **Word2vec** representation (skip gram) to vectorize words in a 100 dimension space

* The preprocessing tasks have been done using a function process_tweet in ( utils.py ) 

* Then a simple Logistic regression to train the model
